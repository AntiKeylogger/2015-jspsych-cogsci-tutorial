## afternoon

* hands-on with the library
* working on own experiment, with roaming help
* provide list of some canonical experiments that would be really useful to implement for purposes like demos & teaching. ultimate goal is to create a repository of canonical experiments that can be used in classroom demonstrations, and also as models for building new jspsych experiments.
  * stroop/flanker, n-back, visual search pop out, free recall, deep v shallow encoding, iat, change blindness, simple versus choice reaction time, wm span,
  semantic priming, etc...
