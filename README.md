## Repository Contents

### hello-world

This folder contains a working copy of the [hello-world example](http://docs.jspsych.org/tutorials/hello-world/) from the jsPsych documentation.

### lexical-decision

The lexical decision task example. There are three versions of the experiment in this folder.

* `experiment-instructions-only.html` contains a truncated version of the experiment with only the instructions trial.
* `experiment.html` contains the full version of the experiment as covered in the tutorial.
* `experiment-with-mean-rt.html` is an extended version of the experiment that shows how to access data generated by the participant to compute a mean response time for each condition and an overall accuracy score. These values are then displayed to the participant at the end of the experiment.

### plugin-development
